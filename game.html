        <p class="w3-light-gray w3-padding">The main protagonist of the game. At the start of God of War II, Kratos is the God of War 
          after defeating Ares but not being released from his torment made his sorrow boil into hatred and anger for the Gods. He turns
          to his mortal army of Sparta to wage war on cities across the lands of Greece, which raises the anger of Zeus and the other 
          gods. Soon, he finds he is betrayed by Zeus and reduced to a mortal and his powers are taken away from him. Kratos must then 
          travel to the Sisters of Fate to exact revenge, take back his godly powers and destroy Zeus once and for all.

        <p class="w3-light-gray w3-padding">The goddess of wisdom, defensive war and industry, and the deuteragonist. Though a constant 
          companion in the first game, Athena only appears three times; to warn Kratos his actions are displeasing the other gods, while 
          channeling herself through a statue, and to save Zeus by stepping in the way of Kratos' killing blow.

          other Titans, she was banished in the War of the Titans, and seeing Kratos' quest for revenge on Zeus, offers to lend her 
          power to his cause. She helps Kratos throughout his journey in hopes that together they can bring about the fall of Olympus. 
          She also acts as the narrator of the game.

          from grace, Atlas would cooperate with the goddess Persephone in order to destroy the world, but was defeated by Kratos. 
          Defeated and contained, Atlas was forced to carry the world on his shoulders, as he would forever remain at the top of the 
          Pillar of the World. He serves as the secondary antagonist in God of War: Chains of Olympus and as an ally in God of War II.

        <p class="w3-light-gray w3-padding">Magical blades Bestowed on Kratos by the goddess Athena. They function as the same weapon 
          as the Blades of Chaos, but these were given to Kratos as he ascends to Godhood by Athena, and after Ares had taken the Blades 
          of Chaos from Kratos during the final battle in God of War. Weakest of the other weapons, the Blades of Athena are still fast 
          and reliable in close combat.

        <p class="w3-light-gray w3-padding">A divine sword so powerful it was the blade that allowed Zeus to defeat the Titans it can 
          also harm and kill other Gods. The weapon can be powered up with experience orbs to increase its power and add new attacks. 
          However, the Blade of Olympus, normally a weapon provided solely by plot developments, can only be used during the fight with 
          the Colossus, fighting Zeus in the last bit of gameplay, and via Bonus Play.
