          during a dire Crisis. However, he did so at the cost of his life. Gone, but far from forgotten, his legacy lives on with every

          Slade Wilson AKA Deathstroke

          betrayed by Billy during the mission and left to fight against Edward Fyers alone, until Oliver washed up on the island. 
          The two began a fight against Fyers in an effort to stop his plot and leave the island, but continued to become embroiled in 
          conflicts and conspiracies that revolved around it. Later, his and Oliver's involvement in these conflicts with the mad 
          scientist Anthony Ivo got him killed, leading to Oliver injecting him with a "miracle" serum developed by WWII-era Japan called 
          the Mirakuru. As a result, Slade came back to life with superhuman abilities, but went completely insane and tried to make 
          Oliver suffer. He continues this crusade into Season Two's present day, where he becomes the main villain for that arc. However,
          after a short return as a villain in Season 3, the effect of the Mirakuru slowly completely leaves his body and he comes to 
          regret his horrible deeds. When Oliver asks for his help against Prometheus in Season 5, Slade willingly assists him, trying to 
          atone for his crimes. Another Season later, Oliver returns the favour, with the two finally parting as friends again.

          joins HIVE out of spite. However, when HIVE wants to destroy the world with no survivors, he goes back to Team Arrow to help
